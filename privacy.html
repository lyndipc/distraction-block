        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Distraction Block is a browser extension designed to help you stay
            focused by blocking distracting websites. We take your privacy
            seriously and have designed this extension to respect your data.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            Distraction Block does not collect, store, or transmit any personal
            data. All of your settings (including your list of blocked websites)
            are stored locally in your browser using the browser's storage API.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Usage</h2>
        <p>The only information stored by this extension is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your list of blocked websites</li>
            <li>Whether blocking is currently enabled or disabled</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This information is only used to provide the core functionality of
            the extension and never leaves your device.
        </p>
